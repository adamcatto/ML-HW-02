\section{Introduction}
The main goal of this assignment is to implement a linear classifier to perform multiclass classification. In order to initialize the relevant weights $\omega$ for the classifier, there are two approaches to take: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initialize $\omega$ with the first data point of the dataset
	\item Initialize $\omega$ using linear regression
\end{enumerate}
For approach (2), we are meant to also implement our own linear regression algorithm. Finally, we are to train and validate our implementation using 5 samples from the scikit-learn datasets ``Breast cancer'' and ``Iris''.

\section{Solution}

\subsection{Linear Regression Implementation}
To do linear regression, we are to solve the least squares error problem for a dataset. We have a system of equations represented as 
$$ X\omega = \mathbf{y}$$We can approximate a solution to this by setting an error term $r = X\omega - \mathbf{y}$, and minimize the size of $r$ – this is the least-squares approximation of a solution to the system of equations.\\ 
 \\
To solve for $\omega$, we take the following derivation steps:
\begin{gather}
X\omega = \mathbf{y} \\
 \implies X^T X\omega = X^T \mathbf{y}\\
  \implies \omega = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \mathbf{y}
\end{gather}
